# Wim Hof Method Notes

#### TL-DR

There is some evidence the mind-body connection created by breathing techniques and cold water exposure can assist the bodies immune system by encouraging the production of brown adipose tissue (brown fat).  A cold shower a day keeps the doctor away.

#### Personal Background

I was drawn to the Wim Hof method as an effective tool to help manage workplace stress.  For 2 - 3 years I have been doing 20 minutes of breathing exercises ~3 times per week.

In January I purchased a commercial ice maker and have been having serious ice baths ~3 times per week.  

Recently Kelly and I have been having both an ice bath and doing the breathing exercises every single day.    


#### Who/What is Wim Hof

Wim Hof is a Dutchman who claims to have developed a connection between his neo-frontal cortex and his brain stem allowing him to perform seemingly impossible feats by controlling his autonomic immune system.

- Climbed Mt Everest wearing only a pair of shorts
- Ran a marathon in the desert without water
- ~15 Guinness world records (longest time sitting in an ice cube etc)

This is a great starting point, it's also a very motorvating and uplifting watch.

#### What is my breathing protocol?

- Lie down on the bed
- Headphones on, phone on silent
- Guided breathing YouTube video, listening only via headphones
- 3 - 4 rounds of breathing taking (~5 mins per round)

A round of breathing has three stages

1. Controlled hyperventilation - "With your mind follow your breath." Breathing all the way in as much air as you can then rather than breathing out just "let go" and let your body exhale.  Concentrate on the inhalation of each breath making each breath as big as you can.  Repeat this for 30 - 60 breaths.
2. Exhale ALL the air out of your lungs and hold your breath as long as you can.  Your body has so much stored oxygen from step 1 that you can hold your breath for much longer than usual.
3. When you feel the urge to breath, you breath in all the way, and keep it.  Then you squeeze your stomach, chest, neck then the head in that order.  Hold this squeeze for 10 - 15 seconds.

You should feel tingling & equphoria - lean into these feelings.

#### What is my ice bath protocol?
 
- 240 litre wheelie bin
- 20 - 40kg ice
- Timer / spotter

1. Put ice in bin
2. Put self in bin
3. Start timer when shoulders are under the water

- First 30 seconds is filled with feelings of panic
- Second 30 seconds is the most painful
- After a minute things become very peaceful
- 2 minutes is a good starting goal
- 5 minutes once you're used to it

#### How does the breathing make me feel?

Like a lot of people, my mind often descends down neurotic spirals.  The breathing sessions give me an overwhelming feeling of calm, thankfulness and a sense that everything will be ok.

There is a meditative component to the breathing routine.  I find it far easier to focus on the breathing rounds than I do to sit still and meditate the traditional way.  


#### How does the cold water make me feel?

- I hate the cold
- I hate ice baths 
- I hate cold showers

But regular exposure to these has meant that I am now in control of my reaction to the cold and this is a very empowering feeling.

- I no longer fear the cold as I am in control
- After being in the ice, for the rest of the day I have this overwhelming feeling of being in control of my life.  Sitting in a bucket of ice and controlling my breathing is far harder than difficult work phone calls or other day-to-day stress.
